Introduction
Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game that’s regarded today as a worldwide classic. It requires two or more players and takes place on a board with numbered, gridded squares. Throughout the board, there are snakes and ladders which connect different squares. Players roll a die and navigate the board. Landing on a ladder advances a player to a square further up the board, while landing on a snake means they have to go back to a previous square.The aim of the game is to reach the final square. The game is a race that’s based on sheer luck, and is popular with children.
